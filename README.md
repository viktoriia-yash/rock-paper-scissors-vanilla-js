# rock-paper-scissors-vanilla-js
This project is a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. The main goal was to create this game using vanilla js.
To create it, I used:
<ul>
<li>Vanilla js, HTML5 and CSS3</li>
<li>GitHub Pages for hosting</li>
</ul>

Thanks to all tutorials, I managed to do this project right and it meets all requirements. I recommend you look at it on your pc and laptops with at least a 13' display size. Without a mobile version, this project drained my whole soul.
