# rock-paper-scissors-vanilla-js
This project is a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. The main goal was to create this game using vanilla js.
To create it, I used:
<ul>
<li>Vanilla js, HTML5 and CSS3</li>
<li>GitHub Pages for hosting</li>
</ul>

For this project, I decided to use the "updated" version of my design of <a href="https://github.com/viktoriia-yash/weather-app-vanilla-js">this</a> weather app. It wasn't easy, but I am pleased with the result. Unfortunately, as last time, I can't figure out how to do a good-looking mobile version. So I decided to leave it at that.

This project was created on a laptop with a 13' display size. So I recommend you look at it on your pc and laptops with at least a 13' display size.

Thanks to all tutorials on the Internet, I managed to do this project right and it meets all requirements now.
